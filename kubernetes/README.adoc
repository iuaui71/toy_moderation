You can clone this repository into your environment and alter the yaml files according to your needs

[source, bash]
git clone https://github.com/iuaui71/toy_moderation.git
cd toy_moderation/kubernetes
kubectl create -f namespace.yaml
kubectl create -f registrysecret.yaml
kubectl create -f frontend.yaml
kubectl create -f backend.yaml
kubectl create -f frontendservice.yaml
kubectl create -f backendservice.yaml

You need to alter at least the following configuration items

In frontend.yaml and backend.yaml:
